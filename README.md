# Data-Science-World---Religion-Peace-GDP

This dataset allows you to understand the world through the lens of a few important factors - money, religion, and peace. I have used machine learning to predict the percentage of atheists based on GPI and GDP per capita. I have randomly split the data (training data forms 70% of the data and the rest 30% is the test data) and predicted values using Linear Regression.
My model testifies that if a country has high GDP and low GPI (or rather a better GPI rank), then it is more likely to have a higher percentage of atheists.

GPI refers to Global Peace Index and is represented with a global rank as well as a score. GDP is annualized, per capita, and presented in U.S. dollars. Data compiled from various sources:
